# Pacman
This game is developed on Pygame library of python. 

Except for the maze layout, it is pretty much similar to the famous PACMAN game i.e it has eggs as goals and multiple enemies in each stage of game.

There are bonus fruits as well which gives 5 extra scores.

Any suggestions for improvemnt will be helpful :)
